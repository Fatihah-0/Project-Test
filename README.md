I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.

<p>This is the frist line using HTML format.<br>
And this is the second line</p>

**bold text**. 
1. This is list
   a. This is sub-list
   b. This is second sub-list
3. This is second item

- I can make unordered list to!
- like this.
- this is code
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>Test</title>
    </head>
My favorite search engine is [Google](https://google.com "Basic").

I learn how to code in here: <https://rakamin.com>
